# House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the XGBoost machine learning model.

## Project Overview

The project aims to predict house prices based on various features using the XGBoost model. The steps involved in the project are:

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

- **Load Dataset:** Import the dataset containing housing data.
- **Initial View:** Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
- **Summary Statistics:** Compute descriptive statistics to gain insights into data distribution.
- **Check for Missing Values:** Identify and handle any missing data in the dataset.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Drop Unnecessary Columns:** Remove columns that do not contribute to the prediction task.
- **Convert Data Types:** Ensure all data types are appropriate for analysis.
- **Handle Missing Values:** Fill missing values in numeric columns to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Encode Categorical Variables:** Transform categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

### 3. Feature Selection

- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore correlations between features and the target variable (house prices).
- **Select Features:** Choose relevant features that exhibit strong correlations with house prices for model training.

### 4. Model Building and Evaluation

- **Model Selection:** Implement the XGBoost machine learning model for prediction.
- **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Training:** Train the XGBoost model on the training set.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
- **Visualize Results:** Plot graphs and charts to visualize model predictions and performance metrics.

### 5. Select the Best Model

- **Identify Best Model:** Select the XGBoost model variant with the best performance based on evaluation metrics.
- **Make Predictions:** Use the best-performing model to make predictions on new data.

### 6. Retrain Best Model

- **Train on Full Dataset:** Retrain the selected XGBoost model using the entire dataset to maximize predictive accuracy.
- **Predict House Prices:** Generate predictions for house prices using the retrained model.

### 7. Analysis and Visualization

- **Interpret Results:** Analyze predictions and visualize trends to gain insights into factors influencing house prices.
- **Optimize Model:** Fine-tune the XGBoost model parameters for improved accuracy and efficiency.

## Results and Conclusion

The project concludes with actionable insights for stakeholders, providing a reliable method to predict house prices effectively using the XGBoost machine learning model.
